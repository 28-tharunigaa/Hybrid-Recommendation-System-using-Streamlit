# Hybrid Recommendation System using Streamlit

A Hybrid Recommendation System that combines **Collaborative Filtering** and **Clustering** to deliver accurate and personalized product or content recommendations. Built with **Python** and deployed via **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Collaborative Filtering based on user-item interaction
- 🤖 K-Means Clustering for user or item segmentation
- 🧠 Hybrid model combining both methods for enhanced accuracy
- 🖼️ Data visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) to explore results
- ⚡ Streamlit interface for real-time input and recommendations
- 📥 Upload your own dataset or use sample data

---

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hybrid-recommender-streamlit.git
cd hybrid-recommender-streamlit
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧪 How It Works

* **Collaborative Filtering**: Predicts user preferences by analyzing the behavior of similar users.
* **Clustering**: Groups users/items using K-Means to reduce noise and improve scalability.
* **Hybrid Approach**: Merges outputs from both models to provide better recommendations.
